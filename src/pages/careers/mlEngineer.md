#### About us:

Wild Me is a small non-profit focused on creating and maintaining open source software and machine learning models to support wildlife biologists, researchers, and conservationists across the globe. Our staff are software professionals and machine learning engineers, and our work helps speed and scale field conservation efforts as they seek to combat extinction.

#### Summary:
As our Machine Learning (ML) Engineer, you will be responsible for assessing and developing new solutions to computer vision problems that plague our customers. You must be a voice for machine learning best practices to balance against ever evolving user and development needs. You will synthesize and apply academic knowledge in a practical environment, growing our tool suite and refining our model coverage while working with an enthusiastic team that loves building ML models from images and metadata of some of the planet’s most amazing animals. Some of your example job responsibilities include:

 - Reading new computer vision papers and understanding related GitHub codebases for animal classification, detection, segmentation, re-identification, and more.
 - Working with academic researchers to create plugins for third party algorithms and hardening them for production use.
 - Meeting with biologists and data brokers for new species and identifying the ML challenges they face and then offering existing tools or new solutions to their automation needs.
 - Utilizing headless Ubuntu servers in a datacenter (or cloud) that have GPUs for accelerated training.
 - Training, retraining, analyzing performance, and finally deploying ML models and code via GitHub and CDN into containerized workers.
 - Supporting and repeatedly optimizing production deployments of your work.

#### We would like you to:

 - Want to be a leader in computer vision with an existing, strong foundational background in ML.This a requirement for consideration.
 - Be excited to dig into state-of-the-art models, validating for accuracy and viability for cross-application across use cases and species.
 - Translate complex jargon and technology into understandable reports for laymen ML users and consumers.
 - Have a strong background in Python programming and development. Open source contribution experience is desired but not required.
 - Dig into traditional software development when that becomes a priority.
 - Have experience deploying and maintaining trained models.
 - Seek out, expose, and destroy bias in ML models. 
 - Ask a lot of questions of all data. Proper data prep is a critical step in all ML work.
 - Be able to discuss API-design and implementation. 
 - Be comfortable working in a virtual team environment that spans engineering and academic contributors.
